# Fashion App

This is a fashion web application built with React and Material UI. The app showcases a modern fashion shopping experience, where users can search for their favorite brand and easily navigate through different sections of the website.

The app features a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and dynamic content that adapts across all devices, ensuring a seamless experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

## Features

### Search Bar
The app includes a search bar where users can search for brands. The search updates in real-time, providing dynamic feedback based on user input.

### Responsive Design
The app uses Material UIâ€™s Grid system to adjust the layout based on the screen size:
- **Mobile**: Uses a single column layout with a hamburger menu for navigation.
- **Tablet and Desktop**: Displays multiple columns and navigation links in the top header.

### Navigation Drawer (Mobile View)
On mobile devices, the app features a navigation drawer that slides from the right. This drawer includes important links like "About Us," "Gift Card," and "Contact Us," and provides an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly navigation option.

### Card Layout
The app uses a grid-based layout for displaying brand cards. Each card represents a fashion brand, showing its logo and description. The cards are displayed in a responsive grid format, with one card per row on mobile devices, two on tablets, and three on desktops.
